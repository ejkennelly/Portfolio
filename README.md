# responsivePortfolio
For this project, I created a portfolio site using bootstrap that is responsive to different size screens. 
I used bootstrap's CDN to link to their styling, and used columns and rows to create an even layout. 
Here is a [link](https://ejkennelly.github.io/Portfolio/) to my responsive portfolio!
